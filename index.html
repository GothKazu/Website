      <p>
        I am new to coding however i find it enjoyable and am eager to learn
        more. I am currently enrolled in Lambda School and working on many
        projects for my portfolio.

        <p>
          I originally wanted to write this on a blog (Medium account linked below), however I did not have a
          blog at the time, and when i created one, it was a bit late to write in the same manner i would've
          preffered to.
          <br /><br />Future blog posts will be posted to Medium and then linked here.
        </p>

        <p>
          For my first build week i was tasked with creating an about page from scratch for the "Spotify Song 
          Suggester" project. At first i had significant difficulty with this request due to not having a design
          file or example. However all my troubles were all in my head.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Before I even began working, I had already decided that I was so bad at design that this would be a train
          wreck. It took me a few hours to realize that even though design isnt my best area, doing nothing would be
          worse as a failing grade is the worst case scenario.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            So I began designing what I figured would be a "at least I tried" attempt. However as I worked, moving things around and changing sizes and order, I began
          trying harder and harder to the point where I was not satisfied with the 10 developers (including myself)
          being paired up in 5 rows of 2.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
          Our Project Lead Andre and our single Back End developer Daniel were the only
          ones of their titles and i could not stand it. I don't have OCD but I've picked up tendencies from the many
          people in my life who do. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          So I tried my BEST to get those two on their on rows at all display sizes. I tried many things that i won't 
          get into too many details for, due to the non-programming audience. Just know that i spent at least 6 hours
          on this one effect. While it may not be glamorous or extravagent, its mine and it got me an A+ on my portion
          of the grade.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I suppose the lesson I learned in this, my very first Build Week in Lambda School, is that: 
        </p>
        <p class = "Lesson">
        You never know what you can do, until you do it.
        <br />Telling yourself what you can and can't do is a recipe
          for failure.
